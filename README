This is version 2009041002 of Test::Regexp, a module to test regular
expressions with.

It's a pure perl module, and should install anywhere using

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install


The module requires Perl 5.10 or later. It will not work on 5.8.x or
before, and there are no plans to backport it.

Development versions can be retrieved from github.

Version 2009033101 was finished during the qa-hackathon 2009 in Birmingham.
